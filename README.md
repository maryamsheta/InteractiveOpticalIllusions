# InteractiveOpticalIllusions
This web-based project features 10 interactive optical illusions designed to challenge users' perception. Built with p5.js, it lets users engage with visuals that play tricks on the mind and uncover the hidden truths behind each illusion in a fun, interactive way. Note: Some illusions may not work properly on touch devices.
